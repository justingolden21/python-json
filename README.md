# python-json

A simple data manager for command line, written in python.

Use dataStorage.py as a simple json library for python.

### Files

data.json: a json file where the data is stored.

dataStorage.py: a python script that inteacts with data.json

dataManager.py: a python script that interacts with the user to edit data via dataStorage.py

### Uses

Run dataManager.py (double click, or cd into folder then <code>py dataManager.py</code>) for a simple experience editing data. dataManager is a good example of what you can do with dataStorage.py.

Use dataStorage.py in your project to easily abstract the problem of interacting with data. You can use it in your python 3 project by typing: <code>import dataStorage</code> at the top. Remember to include a data.json file with <code>{}</code> if using this script (you can copy the one included here).

Open data.json with a text editor to view the contents of the data, stored as a json. Note that at minimum <code>{}</code> is required to edit the data via dataStorage.py.
